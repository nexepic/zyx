## Reading Guide

- `zyx_vs_best` is 1 when ZYX is the fastest row for the workload; > 1 means ZYX is slower than the best row.
- `zyx_vs_fastest_non_zyx` compares ZYX with the fastest other database; < 1 means ZYX is faster than every non-ZYX competitor.
- `zyx_p95/p50` highlights tail-latency volatility for ZYX within this run.
- `zyx_first/p50` highlights first measured iteration cost; use `execution_mode=opened` for first-query-after-open samples and `execution_mode=cold-ish` for less cache-amortized query samples.
- The comparison uses p50 latency and only includes successful rows with at least one sample.
